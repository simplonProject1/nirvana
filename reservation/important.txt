for the reservation part of the page to work properly you need to:

1. create a table called "nirvana" in mysql:

	CREATE TABLE nirvana ( 
    		startDate DATE, 
    		endDate DATE, 
    		destination TEXT,
    		firstName TEXT,
    		lastName TEXT,
    		email TEXT
	); 

2. add a "config.php" file in reservation directory

	content:

	<?php

		$servername = "localhost";
		$username = "root"; 
		$password = "Your database password"; 
		$dbname = "Your database name";

	?>

3. if something is not clear let me know :)
